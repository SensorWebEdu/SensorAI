    "PCA is employed to transform the observed mixed signals into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. In the context of BSS, PCA can be applied to the covariance matrix of the observed signals. The principal components are ordered in terms of their variances, and by selecting a subset of these components, one can achieve a decorrelated representation of the mixed signals. However, PCA does not guarantee independence."

    "ICA takes the process further by aiming to find a linear transformation of the observed signals such that the resulting components are statistically independent. The key assumption is that the sources are statistically independent, which allows ICA to effectively separate them. Mathematically, given a matrix $ $ representing the observed mixtures, ICA seeks a demixing matrix $ W $ such that $ S = WX $, where $ S $ contains the estimated source signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem in ICA is often formulated as maximizing the non-Gaussianity of the estimated sources. One common approach uses negentropy as a measure of non-Gaussianity, leading to objective functions like:\n",

    "$$ J(W) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}[E\\{G(u_i)\\} - E\\{G(v_i)\\}] $$\n",

    "\n",
    "In summary, while PCA focuses on decorrelating signals, ICA goes a step further by exploiting the statistical independence of sources, making it a powerful tool for blind source separation in scenarios where source signals are assumed to be statistically independent."

    "The adaptive filter is a type of digital filter that adjusts its parameters based on the input data it receives. In simpler terms, it's a filter that can change its behavior to better match the characteristics of the signals it processes.\n",

    "$$ y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} w[k] \\cdot x[n-k] $$\n",

    "- $w[k]$ is the adaptive coefficient associated with the $k$-th delayed input, and\n",
    "- $M$ is the number of coefficients in the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that during operation, the filter adjusts its coefficients $ w[k] $ based on the difference between its output and some desired signal. This adaptation is typically achieved using algorithms like the Least Mean Squares (LMS) or Recursive Least Squares (RLS)."

It finds an optimal warping path by minimizing the accumulated distance between corresponding points. Mathematically, given sequences $ A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$ and $B = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]$, DTW constructs a cost matrix $C$ where $C(i, j)$ represents the local distance between $a_i$ and $b_j$.  It then calculates an optimal path from $C(1, 1)$ to $ C(n, m)$ through dynamic programming. DTW is widely used in pattern recognition, speech processing, and signal analysis for aligning time series data."

    "\n",
    "Fourier Transform of a real-valued signal is complex-symmetric whose negative frequencies are redundant with respect to the positive frequencies. To remove the redundancy, the analytic signal is invented. It is complex-valued but its spectrum will be one-sided (only positive frequencies) that preserved the spectral content of the original real-valued signal. Using an analytic signal instead of the original real-valued signal, is useful in many signal processing applications. For example, in spectral analysis, use of analytic signal in-lieu of the original real-valued signal mitigates estimation biases and eliminates cross-term artifacts due to negative and positive frequency components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the frequency domain, the analytic signal has only the postive part of the original signal and the magnitude is two times of the orignal postive spectrum. In the time domain, the real part of the analytic signal is the same as the original signal, but it has a imaginary part.\n",

To minimize the impact of Frequency Leakage, the original signal can be multiplied by a window function. After framing, we get many framed segment.

    "## SynchroSqueezing Transform (SST)\n",
    "\n",
    "SST is a signal processing technique designed to analyze the time-frequency structure in non-stationary and non-linear signals. SST aims to enhance the resolution of signals in the time-frequency domain, particularly when dealing with non-linear and non-stationary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-Frequency Localization:** SST seeks to capture the instantaneous frequency information of a signal by localizing it on the time-frequency plane. This allows for a more accurate analysis of the time and frequency characteristics of non-stationary signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reassignment Representation:** SST employs a technique known as reassignment representation, redistributing the signal on the time-frequency plane. This helps improve the resolution of local structures in the signal, making it easier to identify and analyze features in the time-frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sync Reassignment:** The core idea of SST involves remapping the spectral information of the Fourier transform onto the time-frequency plane, obtaining a more refined and accurate time-frequency analysis of the signal. This sync reassessment allows for better detection of instantaneous frequency changes in the signal.\n"
